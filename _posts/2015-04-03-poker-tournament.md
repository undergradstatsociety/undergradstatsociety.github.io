Join Giving What We Can: Penn on April 3rd in Amado Recital Hall (Irvine auditorium) for our first annual charity poker tournament. 

Please contact Giving What We Can: Penn if you have any questions about the tournament structure. Additionally food and drinks will be provided thanks to our sponsors Manakeesh Cafe and Bakery, and Graduate and Professional Student Assembly (GAPSA)

The charities have been selected by members of Raising for Effective Giving (a group of Effective Altruist Poker Players). They are Deworm the World Initiative and GiveDirectly - both are fantastic charities recommended by GiveWell, with a ton of evidence behind them. We will be running a modified giving game so that each attendee will decide the charity they prefer their ticket sale money to go toward. 

Who should attend this event? Anyone and everyone! If you like poker, you should come! If you like delectable food, you should come! If you enjoy learning about charities and making a positive impact on the world, please come! We hope you can make it, it promises to be an exciting evening. Sign up to reserve your spot using the google form below, as spaces are limited!

Thanks to GAPSA for sponsorship

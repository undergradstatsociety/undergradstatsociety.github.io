*Which charities should we give to in order to maximize the impact of our donation? Where can we find reliable information about the impact a charity has? Last Wednesday’s IMPACT Magazine launch event, a ‘Giving Game’, was designed to address these questions, and resulted in $580 being donated to effective charities! It was hosted in collaboration with a new student group at Penn, Giving What We Can (GWWC).* Rossa O’Keeffe-O’Donovan *and* Peter Buckley *review the event and discuss plans for the new group on campus - to find out more, there will be a meeting on Tuesday 1st April, 9pm.*

Last Wednesday IMPACT launched Issue 2 of its brilliant print magazine, on Giving, and invited us to host a Giving Game at the launch event. For those who missed out, the Giving Game allowed every participant to allocate $10 from an anonymous donor to one of two pre-selected charities. Participants made this decision based on evidence, critically assessing which charity would do more good with their money - more information can be found in [last week’s blog](/blog/2014/03/12/giving-game-intro).

So what happened!? There were a number of lively discussions in 5 different groups, with good points raised in favor (and against!) both charities, Schistosomiasis Control Initiative and GiveDirectly. In the end $580 was raised: $370 went to SCI and $210 to GiveDirectly! (Donation receipts are posted at the bottom of the page, alongside voting details).

The discussions were of a very high quality, and some very pertinent questions were raised: what is the long term impact of my donation? What are the causes of the problems we are trying to tackle? Is it better to spend donor’s money on very cheap and very effective medicine, or to let the recipients choose how to spend the money themselves?

We do not have definitive answers to all of these questions, but we gave a short presentation on how some professional organizations invest significant resources in trying to best answer them. The slides for the presentation can be found online [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lM3bBGy9CmVZRhesMSAj-dk0MppSkc5X6AmxYO0DAFA/edit), and links to some of the organizations discussed in the presentation are below:

- [Giving What We Can](http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/) GWWC members pledge 10% of their income to effective charities (1% for students), and GWWC recommends effective charities to their members based on thorough research
- [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/) conducs extremely thorough research on charity effectiveness, and currently recommends 3 top charities
- [The Life You Can Save](http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/) members pledge at least 1% of their income to effective charities, which are again researched and recommended. The founder, Peter Singer, gives a great 15 minute TED talk on Effective Altruism below.

To raise awareness of the information available on some charities that can achieve a truly amazing amount of impact with even small donations, we are setting up Giving What We Can:Penn (GWWC:Penn). The group will host a range of events and campaigns, including more Giving Games, in partnership with other student groups at Penn. If you are interested in getting involved, there are a variety of great positions available - there will be a planning meeting at 9pm on Tuesday April 1st in the conference room on the ground floor of McNeil building.

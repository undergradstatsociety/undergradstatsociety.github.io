This is an informal open meeting and social mixer for people already involved, or interested in getting involved in Effective Altruism at Penn, and in Philadelphia. 

We have lots of different ways to get involved and make a real, measurable impact on the world, and will also be brainstorming ideas for the next 6 months. So come along, bring your ideas and find out more!

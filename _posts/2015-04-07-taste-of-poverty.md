Students at Penn are eating on less than $2.50 a day to raise money for Deworm the World Initiative, on the world's most effective charities!

Giving What We Can: Penn is hosting the campaign at Penn, in partnership with other student groups. We are trying to raise awareness about effective charitable giving: each dollar given to the world's best charities can have an impact hundreds of times larger than giving to an average charity. 

Other groups participating at Penn:
IMPACT is a magazine and community at Penn focused on social change

What are we doing?
To raise money for Deworm the World, students at Penn and in Philadelphia are eating on less than $2.50 a day for at least one day. About half the world spends less than $2.50 a day on food, and this is adjusting for different prices in different countries (using 2005 US dollars).

We'll be donating the money we save and asking for donations as sponsorship to raise more money for this fantastic charity. We'll also be nominating people to join in the challenge for at least a day, and donating the money they save doing this.

Although eating on less than $2.50 a day for a few days by no means comes even close to simulating what living in extreme poverty is really like, we think this may give us a small insight into how lucky we are to have been born into certain circumstances.

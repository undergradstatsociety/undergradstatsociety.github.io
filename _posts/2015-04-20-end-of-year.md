We've had a fantastic first year, and wanted to bring together everyone who has been a part of it, to have some food, drink (and cake!), and celebrate!

We'll also be giving out some free copies of Peter Singer's new book: The Most Good You Can Do!

There'll be food from Hip City Veg, and a cake from Crust Bakery!

We're celebrating a few things:
- GWWC: Penn being one year old!
- GWWC reaching 1000 members globally
- Some of our committee members and ambassadors officially joining GWWC and One for the World

Thanks to GAPSA for sponsorship of the event.

What is the best way to improve health outcomes for the world's poorest people, with a limited budget? Should we focus on single interventions, that we know work and are very effective, such as distributing bednets, deworming children or providing vaccinations? Or should we focus on building an entire health system to provide a complete range of basic services? Or would a slightly different approach be even more effective such as influencing behavior, or providing the tools for people to improve their own health, for example through improved sanitary practices?

We will be exploring these questions through a Giving Game, in which you will be gifted $10 from an anonymous donor, with the one condition that you must allocate it to charity. We will present evidence on three highly effective charities, one taking each approach. Then every participant who attends will allocate to the one they prefer, hopefully answering some of the above questions in the process.

The three charities we will be comparing are Partners in Health (http://www.pih.org/), the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto), and Dispensers for Safe Water (http://www.evidenceaction.org/dispensers/). You can read evaluations of these charities at GiveWell.org.

Food and drinks will be provided, as sponsored by Graduate and Professional Student Assembly (GAPSA).

People who do not attend Penn are very welcome to attend!

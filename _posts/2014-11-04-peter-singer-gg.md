This event is a follow up to Peter Singer's talk at Penn on October 22nd, where he will donate $5 to charity for every person in attendance at the event. See Peter Singer: The Life You Can Save. For this event, an anonymous donor will donate a further $10 to one of three effective charities for every person who comes to this event. You will get to allocate $10 of their money to whichever charity you think is most effective! The idea is for you to evaluate the information available for each of these charities and decide which one you think will do the most good with your $10.

The three charities will be GiveDirectly, Innovations for Poverty Action, and The Against Malaria Foundation. Extensive evidence about the operations and efficacy of each will be provided, but doing your own research is encouraged! If you want to also personally donate to any of these three excellent charities, we will be matching donations on the night up to $1000.

There will be food (probably pizza) and drinks. After the event there will be time to mingle and chat with members of Giving What We Can: Penn and One for the World for those who are interested in getting involved.

Peter Singer, author of The Life You Can Save and renowned Princeton professor, argues that we can, and should, donate to highly cost effective charities to improve the health and well being of the worldâ€™s poor. Peter Singer is one of the most well-known living philosophers and a leader of the Effective Altruism movement, which applies evidence, reason and rationality to doing good. Prof Singer will discuss the moral case for helping others, and the evidence available to do so most effectively.
